## My process

Getting better in positioning elements and Responsive designs.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The Css clamp() function. It's a game changer for responsive designs.
```css
.element {
  width: clamp(<min-value>, <desired-value>, <max-value>);
}
```
