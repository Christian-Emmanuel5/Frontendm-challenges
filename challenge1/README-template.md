Helpful tools:

- git
- Acode (text editor)
- github

2. How to combine two css rules and the function of **&** in the syntax. like so;
```css 
.combine-element-and-state{
  width: 100px;
  translate: all 1s linear;
  &:hover {
    width: 200px;
  }
}
```
Though supported in modern browsers not ideal for old browsers when considering compactibility.
3. First deployment ever. I learned how to handel 404 errors due to directory levels and file locations
